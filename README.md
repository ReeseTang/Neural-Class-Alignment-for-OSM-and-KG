# Neural Class Alignment for OpenStreetMap and Knowledge Graph
This repository contains the manually generated ground truth and implementation codes for the paper Neural Class Alignment for OpenStreetMap and Knowledge Graphs.

Descriptions:

Steps to obtain tag-to-class matches:

1. Download specific OSM data from https://download.geofabrik.de/ 
2. Run osm_2_rdf.py to get the data in RDF format for further processing. 1st argument is the downloaded geofabrik file and 2nd argument is the file name in which you want to save the rdf triples.
   example command: python osm_2_rdf.py italy-latest.osm.pbf italyRDFWikidata.txt
3. Run notebook readRDFWikidata.ipynb or readRDFDBpedia.ipynb
4. Run notebook schemaMatch.ipynb to get the list which matches generated by the model.
